# CFD-101

In this folder, you'll find the python scripts used on my YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@psvolpiani and in my book "The minimum you need to know to write your own CFD solver". I hope it will give you some clarity on what's behind a CFD solver. If you like the content, don't forget to give a thumbs up and follow the channel. Positive comments are always welcomed. :)
